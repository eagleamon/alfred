Yep, it's ongoing ! :)

The idea is to create a system with a central .. something .. that collects values for every items by the mean of a general communication bus (networked -> MQTT) and thus allowing different instances to run on several machines while accessing the information from everywhere

A bit more: everything should be a module that each instance of alfred could instanciate or not to provide functionalities like bindings, xmpp module, webinterface etc

For the webserver, there should be module as well, for ex a module to interrogate database of movies in xbmc :)
